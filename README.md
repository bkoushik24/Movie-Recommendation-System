# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a hybrid Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on collaborative filtering (user behavior similarity) and content-based filtering (genre similarity). The system is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.
